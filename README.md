# Covid19-Tracker

## What is the Covid19 Tracker 

The Covid19 Tracker presents an interactive dashboard enabling users to get a quick overview of the the overall pandemic situation in each country around the world through the leveraging of Tableau. 

## Data sources

This project is using mainly two data sources: 
  - CSSE Covid19 repo for the Covid19 and vaccination related data (Confirmed cases, Death, Doses administered ...) 
  - Worldbank for the population data 

## How to use the Covid19 tracker 

### Step 1: 
Download all files locally in the folder of your choice and replace the 'YOUR PATH' tag in main.py and function.py by your folder location. 

### Step 2: 
Run the main.py file

During this step, the script is going to download the latest data available in the CSSE Covid19 repo and preprocess it before saving it as an excel file called Dataset.xlsx

### Step3: 
Open the Covid19_Tracker tableau file and update the data source with your newly created DataSet.xlsx 

### Step4: 
Enjoy your Covid19 Tracker showcasing the current Covid19 pandemic situation as well as the current global vaccination status.
